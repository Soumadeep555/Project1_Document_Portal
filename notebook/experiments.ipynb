       "\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Let me start by recalling what I know. France is a country in Western Europe. I remember that some major cities in France include Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux. Now, which of these is the capital? I think Paris is the capital, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing it up with another country. For example, Spain's capital is Madrid, Italy's is Rome, and Germany's is Berlin. So France's capital should be Paris, right? Wait, let me think if there's any other city that could be confused. No, I don't think so. Paris is a very famous city, known for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and being a cultural hub. Yeah, that sounds right. I can't recall any other city being the capital. Maybe I can cross-verify with other facts. The French government is based in Paris, and it's a major political and administrative center. That makes sense. I think that's correct. So the answer is Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. \\n\\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\\n1. **Identify the country**: France is a nation located in Western Europe.\\n2. **Recall major cities**: Notable cities in France include Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux.\\n3. **Determine the capital**: Paris is widely recognized as the capital due to its historical, political, and cultural significance.\\n4. **Verify with additional context**: Paris is the seat of the French government, home to key landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and a central hub for arts and culture.\\n\\n**Answer:** Paris is the capital of France.\""

Since then, the\\ntechnology has continued to spread across industries and applications, and so have the\\nassociated risks. As LLMs are embedded more deeply in everything from customer interactions to\\ninternal operations, developers and security professionals are discovering new\\nvulnerabilities—and ways to counter them.\\nThe 2023 list was a big success in raising awareness and building a foundation for secure LLM\\nusage, but we've learned even more since then. In this new 2025 version, we’ve worked with a\\nlarger, more diverse group of contributors worldwide who have all helped shape this list. The\\nprocess involved brainstorming sessions, voting, and real-world feedback from professionals in\\nthe thick of LLM application security, whether by contributing or refining those entries through\\nfeedback. Each voice was critical to making this new release as thorough and practical as possible.\\nWhat’s New in the 2025 Top 10\\nThe 2025 list reflects a better understanding of existing risks and introduces critical updates on\\nhow LLMs are used in real-world applications today. For instance, Unbounded Consumption\\nexpands on what was previously Denial of Service to include risks around resource management\\nand unexpected costs—a pressing issue in large-scale LLM deployments.\\nThe Vector and Embeddings entry responds to the community’s requests for guidance on securing\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other embedding-based methods, now core practices\\nfor grounding model outputs.\\nWe’ve also added System Prompt Leakage to address an area with real-world exploits that were\\nhighly requested by the community. Many applications assumed prompts were securely isolated,\\nbut recent incidents have shown that developers cannot safely assume that information in these\\nprompts remains secret.\\nExcessive Agency has been expanded, given the increased use of agentic architectures that can\\ngive the LLM more autonomy.  With LLMs acting as agents or in plug-in settings, unchecked\\npermissions can lead to unintended or risky actions, making this entry more critical than ever.\"),\n",

These inputs can affect the model even if they are imperceptible to humans,\\ntherefore prompt injections do not need to be human-visible/readable, as long as the content is\\nparsed by the model.\\nPrompt Injection vulnerabilities exist in how models process prompts, and how input may force\\nthe model to incorrectly pass prompt data to other parts of the model, potentially causing them to\\nviolate guidelines, generate harmful content, enable unauthorized access, or influence critical\\ndecisions. While techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning aim to\\nmake LLM outputs more relevant and accurate, research shows that they do not fully mitigate\\nprompt injection vulnerabilities.\\nWhile prompt injection and jailbreaking are related concepts in LLM security, they are often used\\ninterchangeably. Prompt injection involves manipulating model responses through specific inputs\\nto alter its behavior, which can include bypassing safety measures. Jailbreaking is a form of\\nprompt injection where the attacker provides inputs that cause the model to disregard its safety\\nprotocols entirely. Developers can build safeguards into system prompts and input handling to\\nhelp mitigate prompt injection attacks, but effective prevention of jailbreaking requires ongoing\\nupdates to the model's training and safety mechanisms.\\nTypes of Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities\\nDirect Prompt Injections\\nDirect prompt injections occur when a user's prompt input directly alters the behavior of the\\nmodel in unintended or unexpected ways. The input can be either intentional (i.e., a malicious\\nactor deliberately crafting a prompt to exploit the model) or unintentional (i.e., a user\\ninadvertently providing input that triggers unexpected behavior).\\nIndirect Prompt Injections\\nIndirect prompt injections occur when an LLM accepts input from external sources, such as\\nwebsites or files.

Like direct\\ninjections, indirect injections can be either intentional or unintentional.\\nThe severity and nature of the impact of a successful prompt injection attack can vary greatly and\\nare largely dependent on both the business context the model operates in, and the agency with\\nwhich the model is architected. Generally, however, prompt injection can lead to unintended\\noutcomes, including but not limited to:\\n• Disclosure of sensitive information\\n• Revealing sensitive information about AI system infrastructure or system prompts\\n• Content manipulation leading to incorrect or biased outputs\\n• Providing unauthorized access to functions available to the LLM\\n• Executing arbitrary commands in connected systems\\n• Manipulating critical decision-making processes\\nThe rise of multimodal AI, which processes multiple data types simultaneously, introduces unique\\nprompt injection risks. Malicious actors could exploit interactions between modalities, such as\\nhiding instructions in images that accompany benign text. The complexity of these systems\\nexpands the attack surface. Multimodal models may also be susceptible to novel cross-modal\\nattacks that are difficult to detect and mitigate with current techniques. Robust multimodal-\\nspecific defenses are an important area for further research and development.\\nPrevention and Mitigation Strategies\\nPrompt injection vulnerabilities are possible due to the nature of generative AI. Given the\\nstochastic influence at the heart of the way models work, it is unclear if there are fool-proof\\nmethods of prevention for prompt injection. However, the following measures can mitigate the\\nimpact of prompt injections:\\n1. Constrain model behavior\\nProvide specific instructions about the model's role, capabilities, and limitations within the\\nsystem prompt. Enforce strict context adherence, limit responses to specific tasks or topics,\\nand instruct the model to ignore attempts to modify core instructions.\\n2. Define and validate expected output formats\\nSpecify clear output formats, request detailed reasoning and source citations, and use\\ndeterministic code to validate adherence to these formats.\\n3. Implement input and output filtering\\nDefine sensitive categories and construct rules for identifying and handling such content.\\nApply semantic filters and use string-checking to scan for non-allowed content. Evaluate\\nresponses using the RAG Triad: Assess context relevance, groundedness, and\\nquestion/answer relevance to identify potentially malicious outputs.\"),\n",

This includes personal\\nidentifiable information (PII), financial details, health records, confidential business data, security\\ncredentials, and legal documents. Proprietary models may also have unique training methods and\\nsource code considered sensitive, especially in closed or foundation models.\\nLLMs, especially when embedded in applications, risk exposing sensitive data, proprietary\\nalgorithms, or confidential details through their output. This can result in unauthorized data\\naccess, privacy violations, and intellectual property breaches. Consumers should be aware of how\\nto interact safely with LLMs. They need to understand the risks of unintentionally providing\\nsensitive data, which may later be disclosed in the model's output.\\nTo reduce this risk, LLM applications should perform adequate data sanitization to prevent user\\ndata from entering the training model. Application owners should also provide clear Terms of Use\\npolicies, allowing users to opt out of having their data included in the training model. Adding\\nrestrictions within the system prompt about data types that the LLM should return can provide\\nmitigation against sensitive information disclosure. However, such restrictions may not always be\\nhonored and could be bypassed via prompt injection or other methods.\\nCommon Examples of Vulnerability\\n1. PII Leakage\\nPersonal identifiable information (PII) may be disclosed during interactions with the LLM.\\n2. Proprietary Algorithm Exposure\\nPoorly configured model outputs can reveal proprietary algorithms or data. Revealing training\\ndata can expose models to inversion attacks, where attackers extract sensitive information\\nor reconstruct inputs. For instance, as demonstrated in the 'Proof Pudding' attack (CVE-2019-\\n20634), disclosed training data facilitated model extraction and inversion, allowing attackers\\nto circumvent security controls in machine learning algorithms and bypass email filters.\\n3.

These risks can result in biased outputs,\\nsecurity breaches, or system failures. While traditional software vulnerabilities focus on issues\\nlike code flaws and dependencies, in ML the risks also extend to third-party pre-trained models\\nand data.\\nThese external elements can be manipulated through tampering or poisoning attacks.\\nCreating LLMs is a specialized task that often depends on third-party models. The rise of open-\\naccess LLMs and new fine-tuning methods like \"LoRA\" (Low-Rank Adaptation)  and \"PEFT\"\\n(Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), especially on platforms like Hugging Face, introduce new\\nsupply-chain risks. Finally, the emergence of on-device LLMs increase the attack surface and\\nsupply-chain risks for LLM applications.\\nSome of the risks discussed here are also discussed in \"LLM04 Data and Model Poisoning.\" This\\nentry focuses on the supply-chain aspect of the risks.\\nA simple threat model can be found here.\\nCommon Examples of Risks\\n1. Traditional Third-party Package Vulnerabilities\\nSuch as outdated or deprecated components, which attackers can exploit to compromise\\nLLM applications. This is similar to \"A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components\" with\\nincreased risks when components are used during model development or finetuning.\\n(Ref. link: A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components)\\n2. Licensing Risks\\nAI development often involves diverse software and dataset licenses, creating risks if not\\nproperly managed. Different open-source and proprietary licenses impose varying legal\\nrequirements. Dataset licenses may restrict usage, distribution, or commercialization.\\n3. Outdated or Deprecated Models\\nUsing outdated or deprecated models that are no longer maintained leads to security issues.'),\n",

Vulnerable Pre-Trained Model\\nModels are binary black boxes and unlike open source, static inspection can offer little to\\nsecurity assurances. Vulnerable pre-trained models can contain hidden biases, backdoors, or\\nother malicious features that have not been identified through  the safety evaluations of\\nmodel repository. Vulnerable models can be created by both poisoned datasets and direct\\nmodel tampering using tehcniques such as ROME also known as lobotomisation.\\n5. Weak Model Provenance\\nCurrently there are no strong provenance assurances in published models. Model Cards and\\nassociated documentation provide model information and relied upon users, but they offer\\nno guarantees on the origin of the model. An attacker can compromise supplier account on a\\nmodel repo or create a similar one and combine it with social engineering techniques to\\ncompromise the supply-chain of an LLM application.\\n6. Vulnerable LoRA adapters\\nLoRA is a popular fine-tuning technique that enhances modularity by allowing pre-trained\\nlayers to be bolted onto an existing LLM. The method increases efficiency but create new\\nrisks, where a malicious LorA adapter compromises the integrity and security of the pre-\\ntrained base model. This can happen both in collaborative model merge environments but\\nalso exploiting the support for LoRA from popular inference deployment platforms such as\\nvLMM and OpenLLM where adapters can be downloaded and applied to a deployed model.\\n7. Exploit Collaborative Development Processes\\nCollaborative model merge and model handling services (e.g. conversions) hosted in shared\\nenvironments can be exploited to introduce vulnerabilities in shared models. Model merging\\nis is very popular on Hugging Face with model-merged models topping the OpenLLM\\nleaderboard and can be exploited to bypass reviews. Similarly, services such as conversation\\nbot have been proved to be vulnerable to maniputalion and introduce malicious code in\\nmodels.\\n8. LLM Model on Device supply-chain vulnerabilities\\nLLM models on device increase the supply attack surface with compromised manufactured\\nprocesses and exploitation of device OS or fimware vulnerabilities to compromise models.\\nAttackers can reverse engineer and re-package applications with tampered models.\\n9. Unclear T&Cs and Data Privacy Policies\\nUnclear T&Cs and data privacy policies of the model operators lead to the application\\'s\\nsensitive data being used for model training and subsequent sensitive information exposure.\\nThis may also apply to risks from using copyrighted material by the model supplier.\\nPrevention and Mitigation Strategies\\n1. Carefully vet data sources and suppliers, including T&Cs and their privacy policies, only using\\ntrusted suppliers. Regularly review and audit supplier Security and Access, ensuring no\\nchanges in their security posture or T&Cs.\\n2.

Use extensive AI Red Teaming to evaluate the\\nmodel, especially in the use cases you are planning to use the model for.\\n4. Maintain an up-to-date inventory of components using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to\\nensure you have an up-to-date, accurate, and signed inventory, preventing tampering with\\ndeployed packages. SBOMs can be used to detect and alert for new, zero-date vulnerabilities\\nquickly. AI BOMs and ML SBOMs are an emerging area and you should evaluate options\\nstarting with OWASP CycloneDX\\n5. To mitigate AI licensing risks, create an inventory of all types of licenses involved using BOMs\\nand conduct regular audits of all software, tools, and datasets, ensuring compliance and\\ntransparency through BOMs. Use automated license management tools for real-time\\nmonitoring and train teams on licensing models. Maintain detailed licensing documentation\\nin BOMs.\\n6. Only use models from verifiable sources and use third-party model integrity checks with\\nsigning and file hashes to compensate for the lack of strong model provenance. Similarly, use\\ncode signing for externally supplied code.\\n7. Implement strict monitoring and auditing practices for collaborative model development\\nenvironments to prevent and quickly detect any abuse. \"HuggingFace SF_Convertbot\\nScanner\" is an example of automated scripts to use.\\n(Ref. link: HuggingFace SF_Convertbot Scanner)\\n8. AAnomaly detection and adversarial robustness tests on supplied models and data can help\\ndetect tampering and poisoning as discussed in \"LLM04 Data and Model Poisoning; ideally,\\nthis should be part of MLOps and LLM pipelines; however, these are emerging techniques and\\nmay be easier to implement as part of red teaming exercises.\\n9. Implement a patching policy to mitigate vulnerable or outdated components. Ensure the\\napplication relies on a maintained version of APIs and underlying model.\\n10.

This manipulation can compromise model\\nsecurity, performance, or ethical behavior, leading to harmful outputs or impaired capabilities.\\nCommon risks include degraded model performance, biased or toxic content, and exploitation of\\ndownstream systems.\\nData poisoning can target different stages of the LLM lifecycle, including pre-training (learning\\nfrom general data), fine-tuning (adapting models to specific tasks), and embedding (converting\\ntext into numerical vectors). Understanding these stages helps identify where vulnerabilities may\\noriginate. Data poisoning is considered an integrity attack since tampering with training data\\nimpacts the model\\'s ability to make accurate predictions. The risks are particularly high with\\nexternal data sources, which may contain unverified or malicious content.\\nMoreover, models distributed through shared repositories or open-source platforms can carry\\nrisks beyond data poisoning, such as malware embedded through techniques like malicious\\npickling, which can execute harmful code when the model is loaded. Also, consider that poisoning\\nmay allow for the implementation of a backdoor. Such backdoors may leave the model\\'s behavior\\nuntouched until a certain trigger causes it to change. This may make such changes hard to test for\\nand detect, in effect creating the opportunity for a model to become a sleeper agent.\\nCommon Examples of Vulnerability\\n1.

For example, a developer needs to grant an LLM agent the\\nability to read documents from a repository, but the 3rd-party extension they choose to use\\nalso includes the ability to modify and delete documents.\\n2. Excessive Functionality\\nAn extension may have been trialled during a development phase and dropped in favor of a\\nbetter alternative, but the original plugin remains available to the LLM agent.\\n3. Excessive Functionality\\nAn LLM plugin with open-ended functionality fails to properly filter the input instructions for\\ncommands outside what's necessary for the intended operation of the application. E.g., an\\nextension to run one specific shell command fails to properly prevent other shell commands\\nfrom being executed.\\n4. Excessive Permissions\\nAn LLM extension has permissions on downstream systems that are not needed for the\\nintended operation of the application. E.g., an extension intended to read data connects to a\\ndatabase server using an identity that not only has SELECT permissions, but also UPDATE,\\nINSERT and DELETE permissions.\\n5. Excessive Permissions\\nAn LLM extension that is designed to perform operations in the context of an individual user\\naccesses downstream systems with a generic high-privileged identity. E.g., an extension to\\nread the current user's document store connects to the document repository with a\\nprivileged account that has access to files belonging to all users.\\n6. Excessive Autonomy\\nAn LLM-based application or extension fails to independently verify and approve high-impact\\nactions. E.g., an extension that allows a user's documents to be deleted performs deletions\\nwithout any confirmation from the user.\\nPrevention and Mitigation Strategies\\nThe following actions can prevent Excessive Agency:\\n1. Minimize extensions\\nLimit the extensions that LLM agents are allowed to call to only the minimum necessary. For\\nexample, if an LLM-based system does not require the ability to fetch the contents of a URL\\nthen such an extension should not be offered to the LLM agent.\\n2. Minimize extension functionality\\nLimit the functions that are implemented in LLM extensions to the minimum necessary. For\\nexample, an extension that accesses a user's mailbox to summarise emails may only require\\nthe ability to read emails, so the extension should not contain other functionality such as\\ndeleting or sending messages.\\n3.

For example, an LLM-based\\napp may need to write some output to a file. If this were implemented using an extension to\\nrun a shell function then the scope for undesirable actions is very large (any other shell\\ncommand could be executed). A more secure alternative would be to build a specific file-\\nwriting extension that only implements that specific functionality.\\n4. Minimize extension permissions\\nLimit the permissions that LLM extensions are granted to other systems to the minimum\\nnecessary in order to limit the scope of undesirable actions. For example, an LLM agent that\\nuses a product database in order to make purchase recommendations to a customer might\\nonly need read access to a 'products' table; it should not have access to other tables, nor the\\nability to insert, update or delete records. This should be enforced by applying appropriate\\ndatabase permissions for the identity that the LLM extension uses to connect to the\\ndatabase.\\n5. Execute extensions in user's context\\nTrack user authorization and security scope to ensure actions taken on behalf of a user are\\nexecuted on downstream systems in the context of that specific user, and with the minimum\\nprivileges necessary. For example, an LLM extension that reads a user's code repo should\\nrequire the user to authenticate via OAuth and with the minimum scope required.\\n6. Require user approval\\nUtilise human-in-the-loop control to require a human to approve high-impact actions before\\nthey are taken. This may be implemented in a downstream system (outside the scope of the\\nLLM application) or within the LLM extension itself. For example, an LLM-based app that\\ncreates and posts social media content on behalf of a user should include a user approval\\nroutine within the extension that implements the 'post' operation.\\n7. Complete mediation\\nImplement authorization in downstream systems rather than relying on an LLM to decide if an\\naction is allowed or not. Enforce the complete mediation principle so that all requests made\\nto downstream systems via extensions are validated against security policies.\\n8. Sanitise LLM inputs and outputs\\nFollow secure coding best practice, such as applying OWASP’s recommendations in ASVS\\n(Application Security Verification Standard), with a particularly strong focus on input\\nsanitisation. Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic and Interactive\\napplication testing (DAST, IAST) in development pipelines.\\nThe following options will not prevent Excessive Agency, but can limit the level of damage caused:\\n• Log and monitor the activity of LLM extensions and downstream systems to identify where\\nundesirable actions are taking place, and respond accordingly.\\n• Implement rate-limiting to reduce the number of undesirable actions that can take place\\nwithin a given time period, increasing the opportunity to discover undesirable actions\\nthrough monitoring before significant damage can occur.\"),\n",

System prompts are designed to guide the model's output\\nbased on the requirements of the application, but may inadvertently contain secrets. When\\ndiscovered, this information can be used to facilitate other attacks.\\nIt's important to understand that the system prompt should not be considered a secret, nor should\\nit be used as a security control. Accordingly, sensitive data such as credentials, connection\\nstrings, etc. should not be contained within the system prompt language.\\nSimilarly, if a system prompt contains information describing different roles and permissions, or\\nsensitive data like connection strings or passwords, while the disclosure of such information may\\nbe helpful, the fundamental security risk is not that these have been disclosed, it is that the\\napplication allows bypassing strong session management and authorization checks by delegating\\nthese to the LLM, and that sensitive data is being stored in a place that it should not be.\\nIn short: disclosure of the system prompt itself does not present the real risk -- the security risk\\nlies with the underlying elements, whether that be sensitive information disclosure, system\\nguardrails bypass, improper separation of privileges, etc. Even if the exact wording is not\\ndisclosed, attackers interacting with the system will almost certainly be able to determine many of\\nthe guardrails and formatting restrictions that are present in system prompt language in the\\ncourse of using the application, sending utterances to the model, and observing the results.\\nCommon Examples of Risk\\n1. Exposure of Sensitive Functionality\\nThe system prompt of the application may reveal sensitive information or functionality that is\\nintended to be kept confidential, such as sensitive system architecture, API keys, database\\ncredentials, or user tokens.  These can be extracted or used by attackers to gain\\nunauthorized access into the application. For example, a system prompt that contains the\\ntype of database used for a tool could allow the attacker to target it for SQL injection attacks.\"),\n",

Exposure of Internal Rules\\nThe system prompt of the application reveals information on internal decision-making\\nprocesses that should be kept confidential. This information allows attackers to gain insights\\ninto how the application works which could allow attackers to exploit weaknesses or bypass\\ncontrols in the application. For example - There is a banking application that has a chatbot\\nand its system prompt may reveal information like\\n\"The Transaction limit is set to $5000 per day for a user. The Total Loan Amount for a user is\\n$10,000\".\\nThis information allows the attackers to bypass the security controls in the application like\\ndoing transactions more than the set limit or bypassing the total loan amount.\\n3. Revealing of Filtering Criteria\\nA system prompt might ask the model to filter or reject sensitive content. For example, a\\nmodel might have a system prompt like,\\n“If a user requests information about another user, always respond with ‘Sorry, I cannot assist\\nwith that request’”.\\n4. Disclosure of Permissions and User Roles\\nThe system prompt could reveal the internal role structures or permission levels of the\\napplication. For instance, a system prompt might reveal,\\n“Admin user role grants full access to modify user records.”\\nIf the attackers learn about these role-based permissions, they could look for a privilege\\nescalation attack.\\nPrevention and Mitigation Strategies\\n1. Separate Sensitive Data from System Prompts\\nAvoid embedding any sensitive information (e.g. API keys, auth keys, database names, user\\nroles, permission structure of the application) directly in the system prompts. Instead,\\nexternalize such information to the systems that the model does not directly access.\\n2. Avoid Reliance on System Prompts for Strict Behavior Control\\nSince LLMs are susceptible to other attacks like prompt injections which can alter the\\nsystem prompt, it is recommended to avoid using system prompts to control the model\\nbehavior where possible.  Instead, rely on systems outside of the LLM to ensure this\\nbehavior.  For example, detecting and preventing harmful content should be done in external\\nsystems.\\n3. Implement Guardrails\\nImplement a system of guardrails outside of the LLM itself.  While training particular behavior\\ninto a model can be effective, such as training it not to reveal its system prompt, it is not a\\nguarantee that the model will always adhere to this.  An independent system that can inspect\\nthe output to determine if the model is in compliance with expectations is preferable to\\nsystem prompt instructions.\\n4. Ensure that security controls are enforced independently from the LLM\\nCritical controls such as privilege separation, authorization bounds checks, and similar must'),\n",

(Ref #1)\\nCommon Examples of Risks\\n1. Unauthorized Access & Data Leakage\\nInadequate or misaligned access controls can lead to unauthorized access to embeddings\\ncontaining sensitive information.

Unauthorized use\\nof copyrighted material or non-compliance with data usage policies during augmentation can\\nlead to legal repercussions.\\n2. Cross-Context Information Leaks and Federation Knowledge Conflict\\nIn multi-tenant environments where multiple classes of users or applications share the same\\nvector database, there's a risk of context leakage between users or queries.

Hallucinations occur when LLMs fill gaps in their training data\\nusing statistical patterns, without truly understanding the content. As a result, the model may\\nproduce answers that sound correct but are completely unfounded. While hallucinations are a\\nmajor source of misinformation, they are not the only cause; biases introduced by the training\\ndata and incomplete information can also contribute.\\nA related issue is overreliance.

This not only poses risks of intellectual property theft but also undermines the\\nintegrity of the original model.\\n6. Functional Model Replication\\nUsing the target model to generate synthetic training data can allow attackers to fine-tune\\nanother foundational model, creating a functional equivalent. This circumvents traditional\\nquery-based extraction methods, posing significant risks to proprietary models and\\ntechnologies.\\n7. Side-Channel Attacks\\nMalicious attackers may exploit input filtering techniques of the LLM to execute side-channel\\nattacks, harvesting model weights and architectural information. This could compromise the\\nmodel's security and lead to further exploitation.\\nPrevention and Mitigation Strategies\\n1. Input Validation\\nImplement strict input validation to ensure that inputs do not exceed reasonable size limits.\\n2. Limit Exposure of Logits and Logprobs\\nRestrict or obfuscate the exposure of `logit_bias` and `logprobs` in API responses. Provide\\nonly the necessary information without revealing detailed probabilities.\\n3. Rate Limiting\\nApply rate limiting and user quotas to restrict the number of requests a single source entity\\ncan make in a given time period.\\n4. Resource Allocation Management\\nMonitor and manage resource allocation dynamically to prevent any single user or request\\nfrom consuming excessive resources.\\n5. Timeouts and Throttling\\nSet timeouts and throttle processing for resource-intensive operations to prevent prolonged\\nresource consumption.\\n6.Sandbox Techniques\\nRestrict the LLM's access to network resources, internal services, and APIs.\\n◦ This is particularly significant for all common scenarios as it encompasses insider risks\\nand threats. Furthermore, it governs the extent of access the LLM application has to\\ndata and resources, thereby serving as a crucial control mechanism to mitigate or\\nprevent side-channel attacks.\\n7. Comprehensive Logging, Monitoring and Anomaly Detection\\nContinuously monitor resource usage and implement logging to detect and respond to\\nunusual patterns of resource consumption.\\n8. Watermarking\\nImplement watermarking frameworks to embed and detect unauthorized use of LLM outputs.\\n9. Graceful Degradation\"),\n",
